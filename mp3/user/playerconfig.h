/*Playing a real-time MP3 stream has the added complication of clock differences: if the sample
clock of the server is a bit faster than our sample clock, it will send out mp3 data faster
than we process it and our buffer will fill up. Conversely, if the server clock is slower, we'll
eat up samples quicker than the server provides them and we end up with an empty buffer.
To fix this, the mp3 logic can insert/delete some samples to modify the speed of playback.
If our buffers are filling up too fast (presumably due to a quick sample clock on the other side)
we will increase our playout speed; if our buffers empty too quickly, we will decrease it a bit.
Unfortunately, adding or deleting samples isn't very good for the audio quality. If you
want better quality, turn this off and/or feel free to implement a better algorithm.
WARNING: Don't use this define if you play non-stream files. It will presume the sample clock
on the server side is waaay too fast and will default to playing back the stream too fast.*/
#define ADD_DEL_SAMPLES

/*ADD_DEL_SAMPLES parameter:
Size of the cumulative buffer offset before we are going to add or remove a sample
The higher this number, the more aggressive we're adjusting the sample rate. Higher numbers give
better resistance to buffer over/underflows due to clock differences, but also can result in
the music sounding higher/lower due to network issues.*/

/*Most I2S codecs are okay with getting more than 16 samples, and we can use this to get the
sample rate we send out somewhat closer to the real sample rate of the MP3 stream. Some codecs
however (e.g. the PCM5102) will not output anything when this happens. Undefine the following
define in that case, it makes the I2S port always send out strictly 16-bit samples.*/
#define ALLOW_VARY_SAMPLE_BITS


/*While connecting an I2S codec to the I2S port of the ESP is obviously the best way to get nice
16-bit sounds out of the ESP, it is possible to run this code without the codec. For
this to work, instead of outputting a 2x16bit PCM sample the DAC can decode, we use the I2S
port as a makeshift 5-bit PWM generator. To do this, we map every mp3 sound sample to a
value that has an amount of 1's set that's linearily related to the sound samples value and
then output that value on the I2S port. The net result is that the average analog value on the 
I2S data pin corresponds to the value of the MP3 sample we're trying to output. Needless to
say, a hacked 5-bit PWM output is going to sound a lot worse than a real I2S codec.*/
#define PWM_HACK

/*
As an alternative to the PWM hack, you can also use a 2nd order delta sigma converter to
output directly into an amp/speaker. This is a bit more noisy than the PWM code, but the
noise is concentrated in the higher frequencies: you can easily filter it using a simple 
R/C lowpass filter, eg 100 ohm in series with the output, 100NF from there to ground.
This will clock the ESP at 160MHz; the delta-sigma process eats just a bit too much
CPU power to run stable at 80MHz without causing DMA dropouts.
*/
#define DELTA_SIGMA_HACK

/*While a large (tens to hundreds of K) buffer is necessary for Internet streams, on a
quiet network and with a direct connection to the stream server, you can get away with
a much smaller buffer. Enabling the following switch will disable accesses to the 
23LC1024 code and use a much smaller but internal buffer instead. You want to enable
this if you don't have a 23LC1024 chip connected to the ESP but still want to try
the MP3 decoder. Be warned, if your network isn't 100% quiet and latency-free and/or
the server isn't very close to your ESP, this _will_ lead to stutters in the played 
MP3 stream! */
